# Requirements
Python 3 and Tkinter must be installed

# Setup
Clone the repo or download the files. Go to the directory and run python3 mainUI.py (the driver file)

# Gameplay
1. A popup window will appear asking if you want to play as x or o.
2. x always goes first. If you choose o, the cpu will go first.
3. This program uses the minimax algorithm, and the cpu will always win, or it will be a draw.

# OS Note
The tkinter button color functionality does not work in a macOS environment. This is a known issue 
about this library and I have not set up a workaround yet.
